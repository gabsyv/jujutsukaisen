              <p>
                Toge is a slim young man with light skin, brown eyes, and
                mid-length straight hair. He was born with the "Snake and Fangs"
                seal of the Inumaki clan on his tongue and both cheeks. His
                Jujutsu High uniform was tailored with this in mind, fitted with
                a high collar with a zipper that covers his mouth.

                Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late
                twenties and is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to
                his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes,
                which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes
                with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a
                spikier appearance.

                slender build when wearing baggy clothing, but actually has a
                lean and muscular physique. He also has relatively large light
                brown eyes and spiky pink hair that's styled in an undercut
                fashion. He gains a second pair of eyes that only open when
                Sukuna controls his body along with his many markings.

                Yuta is a young man of average height with disheveled black hair
                and dark blue eyes. As a first-year, Yuta's body language made
                it obvious that he was under a lot of stress. His posture was
                very unconfident, and he still has dark circles under his
                eyelids from a lack of sleep.

                pushed upfront and with tattoos/lines on his forehead, nose,
                cheeks, upper body, and abdomen. He also has a second pair of
                eyes underneath his normal eyes, which are usually closed.
